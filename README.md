**FaceMeshBarracuda** is a lightweight facial capture package providing a
neural network predictor pipeline to generate the approximate geometry of a
human face.

FaceMeshBarracuda is heavily based on the [MediaPipe Face Mesh] package.
Although it's not a straght port of the original package, it uses the same
pre-trained models and structures.
